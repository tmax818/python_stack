# Create a .txt file. For each of the following code snippets, first write down your prediction of the output (what you will see printed to the terminal). Once you've made a prediction, run the code snippet to see if you are correct! If you are confused about how a piece of code works, copy and paste the code in Python Tutor and then "Visualize Execution" to see how it works!
